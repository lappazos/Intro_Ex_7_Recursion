=  README for ex7: Recursion  =
=============================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
In the exercise we implemented different recursion techniques on variuos
functions - linear and non-linear.
the top  of course was the great Hanoi Towers - how glorious.
in all of my non-linear functions (part b, after hanoi) i used main helper func
 for all, in order to avoid code repeat.

=  Special Comments  =
======================
a short bries on recursion limits - how and when exactly we reach too much
recursion depth, and its effect on running time - could be great.
